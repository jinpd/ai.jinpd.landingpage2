# NEXUS - Digital Agency Website

This project is a high-fidelity clone of a modern Korean Web Agency landing page, inspired by top agencies like Vinyl C, I-Partners, and Pentabreed.

## Features
- **Premium Dark Aesthetics**: High contrast, modern typography.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented using Lenis for a "luxury" feel.
- **GSAP Animations**: Complex reveal animations and parallax effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop.
- **No Build Required**: Uses Vanilla JS and CSS with CDN libraries.

## How to Run

Since `npm` was unavailable in the environment, this project is built to run directly in the browser.

1.  Open the folder in VS Code.
2.  Use the "Live Server" extension to open `index.html`.
    *   Or run `python -m http.server` in the terminal and visit `http://localhost:8000`.
3.  Enjoy the experience.

## Assets
- Images are currently CSS placeholders. For a production version, replace the background colors in `style.css` or the `div`s in `index.html` with real `<img>` tags or background images.
